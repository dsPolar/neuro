#Q1 Calculate the Fano Factor of the SPIKE COUNT and CV of the INTER-SPIKE INTERVAL
#   for 1000 seconds of spike train with firing rate 35Hz
#   with refractory period 0 and 5ms
#   Fano Factor should use windows of width 10,50,100ms

#Q2 Calculate the Fano Factor and CV for spike train as above for rho.dat

#Q3 Calculate and plot the spike triggered average for stim.dat

#M1 Calulcate the Stimulus triggered by pairs of spikes
#   For intevals of 2,10,20,50ms calculate the average stimulus before
#   a pair of spikes seperated by that interval
#   For adjacency case and non adjacent
